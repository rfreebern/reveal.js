                        <p>In his book <em>The Visual Display of Quantitative Information</em>, Edward Tufte coined the term “chartjunk” to refer to needless visual flourishes that clutter up informational graphics without improving their effectiveness. Based on this, Jesse James Garrett at AdaptivePath coined the term “CMSjunk”.</p>

                        <p>Good URL paths (and queries too) avoid CMSjunk as much as possible. While we all know that there are technical constraints that sometimes require having an ID number or other identifier in a URL, we try to minimize that. As much as possible, the URL should be <em>usable</em> to a machine, but actively <em>friendly</em> to humans.</p>
                    
                        <p>Additionally a well-designed URL path contributes to a URL’s hackability, which is something—a good thing—that we’ll touch on a bit later.</p>

                        <p>Good queries are brief. If your application can make do with just “?q=search+term”, don’t add extra parameters.

                    <p style="font-family: monospace;" class="fragment">----------- UTF-8 -------------- -------- ??? ------</p>

                    <aside class="notes">
                        <p>Everything up to the question mark is parsed using UTF-8, the query string itself is parsed using the document’s encoding. Except if the document’s encoding is UTF-16, UTF-8 is used instead. The moral is: stick to UTF-8 and you’ll most likely be fine.</p>

                        <p>But what about special characters? I want a URL with a tableflip emoji in it. How does that get handled? That’s where percent-encoding comes in. Anything outside of the normal set of ASCII alphanumeric characters and simple punctuation gets converted into a percent sign. However! The reserved characters for path segments and the query string are different.</p>

                    <aside class="notes">
                        <p>That is the question. In the path segments of a URL, plus signs are fine as-is, but spaces must be encoded to %20. In the query string, plus signs have to be encoded as %2B, but spaces can be represented as either “+” or “%20”.</p>

                        <p>The good news is that there’s work actively being done to improve this. Anne van Kesteren, a Dutch Mozilla employee, is writing a URL spec for the WHATWG that aims to standardize how browsers handle URLs, as well as expose a more consistent and more powerful JavaScript API for working with URLs. </p>

With the <code>history.pushState()</code> API supported in all modern browsers, there’s very little need to use fragments to manipulate session history.

                        <p>This is a little less cut-and-dried, because both URLs have something going for them. However, the first has the strength of <em>positive association</em>: Carnegie Mellon University is known for making advances in research, and that URL looks like it points to a CMU professor’s publication. The second, while it’s designed perfectly well, has no such association, which hurts its credibility in comparison.</p>

Even apparently simple changes that don’t affect the meaning of the statement, like adding alliteration, rhyme, or repetition can lead to people treating it as more credible. Stocks  perform better in the weeks following their IPO if the company’s name is easier to pronounce.</p>

                        <p>This concept applies to URLs as well. When designing your URLs, strive for simple, memorable, and clear. Choose pleasing, semantically clear words for your path segments. Be a little clever, but not confusing. Try to build something that trips off the tongue.</p>

                        The word "hack" has negative connotations, but originally it meant "messing around with something to get it to do what you want". Hacking a URL isn't figuring out how to steal the site's password database, it's figuring out how to get from one page to another without clicking through the site's traditional navigation. It's a power-user shortcut.

                        <p>I mentioned earlier that a well-designed path improves hackability. Hackability is the ability of users to understand intuitively what parts of your URL to change to get to the information they want.</p>
                        <p>This URL is not hackable. Chop off that last path segment (the intuitive and understandable “ref=sr_1_2”) and... nothing changes. Chop off the next one and you get a 404. If you want other Tovolo products, there’s no way to get to them just by exploring the URL structure.</p>

                        <p>This URL is hackable. If you get rid of the repository name, “BostonConference”, it takes you to Michael’s github profile, as you’d probably expect. Drop his username, and you’re at the Github home page.</p>

                        <p>Do users care about hackable URLs? There hasn’t been a definitive study to really determine this, but anecdotal evidence holds that URL hackability is important to power users.</p>
                        <p>In his seminal work “The Humane Interface,” Jef Raskin says, and I’m paraphrasing, that good interfaces allow you to form habits, because they’re predictable. Understanding the URL structure and being able to hack navigating a site is a habit that power users can develop if your URL structure supports it, and habits lead to loyal users.</p>

                        <p>What does a URL-related habit look like? Well, consider usernames. If you know that a site uses URLs like this consistently, and you know someone’s username on Twitter is “@rfreebern”, you might develop the habit of trying a URL like this to see if they’ve done any open-source development, rather than bothering with the intermediate step of running a search. However, if the site used a URL like this with a user ID in the middle, you can’t develop that habit. There’s no way to take a username and guess the URL, so you wouldn’t even try.</p>

                        <p>You want your URLs to be robust. Robustness means they’re hard to screw up when shared.</p>
                        <p>Like I mentioned before, dropping the slug shouldn’t result in a 404.</p>
                        <p>Dropping even a <em>portion</em> of the slug shouldn’t result in a 404, as long as there’s enough there to identify what’s being requested.</p>
                        <p>Why? Copy-and-paste errors that truncate your URL shouldn’t penalize the user. Platforms that erroneously insert linebreaks shouldn’t penalize the user. <em>Changing</em> the slug to something else entirely, however, should.</p>
                        <p>Additionally, avoid generating URLs that contain encoded characters, because the way they’re shared could result in the dreaded %2520, aka double-encoding, or in the other direction, improper decoding.</p>

It’s relatively easy to do, especially with an open-source package like <a href="http://yourls.org/">YOURLS</a>, and lets you tie the convenience of short URLs directly into your platform. Set it up, use its API, and add a shorturl relation link to your documents. And if you want to get <em>really</em> fancy, write a plugin so that it generates its short URL codes using something like Douglas Crockford’s Base32 encoder, or (shameless plug) my base-27 “Easier” encoder, both of which are designed to sacrifice some shortness in order to improve robustness.</p>

                        <p>Robustness also includes the notion of persistence. Tim wrote “Cool URIs don’t change” back in 1998, and what he meant was that, once you’ve put a document on the web at a certain address, you should do your best to make sure that address always works (and that's another reason why you should design your URLs from the start). In the real world, we have to move stuff around constantly. Maybe the company gets acquired. Maybe there’s a platform upgrade. Maybe it gets rebuilt by another company.</p>

                        <p>The key is to use those HTTP 3xx redirects, as many as necessary, to make sure that any URL that ever pointed to document X still gets the user to document X. The thing is, if there's POST data involved, 301, 302, and 303 don't really do what you want -- you POST the data to one URL, the server says "hey, go here instead," and the browser isn't supposed to re-POST the data to the new one. 307 and 308 are meant to provide a method to handle that,a nd when you POST data and receive a 307 or 308, the browser should automatically re-POST the data to the new URL.</p>

                        <p>An important part of designing persistent URLs is hiding implementation details. Just because your application is running under PHP right now doesn’t mean it—or even part of it—won’t get moved to another platform someday. If your URLs end in “.php” and you change the backend code, you either need to change all your URLs and set up redirects, or keep responding at the old URLs despite their inaccuracy. Similarly, if you host a wiki running on MediaWiki or a blog running on WordPress, keep those platform names (and even any indicators of them, such as “mw” or “wp”) out of your public-facing URLs, in case you decide to change platforms someday.</p>

Now do it for every single possible page on your website, including the user-generated ones and the ones that will be added in the future. We’re back to that concept of known knowns, known unknowns, and unknown unknowns.</p>

                        <p>To deal with this, your project needs a URL design from the very beginning. Along with your scope and your spec and your visual and interaction designs, you should have a document about URL design. To write this document, you need a thorough understanding of the structure of the information you’re dealing with how you want people to use the site. You need to think about how new functionality will be added and how that will affect URLs. If you’re rewriting an old system and the URLs are changing, you need to think about how you’re going to set up redirects.</p>

                        <p>Recall this quote. When it comes down to it, the clans we’re building around programming languages are unimportant in the long run. In web development, programming languages, frameworks, best practices, platforms, operating systems, servers come and go constantly. The only constant is the web itself. The smartest thing you can do in software today and in the future is bet on the web, and part of that is embracing those things, like URLs, that make the web what it is. They’re a key part of the web, and they’ll outlast your programming language because they’re bigger than any single programming language. They’re part of the native language of the web, and if you’re going to speak to the web, you have to understand and respect that.</p>
